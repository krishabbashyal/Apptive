Feature Roadmap

Achrievements first

A resume and cover letter tracker. Users often tailor these for each application, so keeping track of which versions they sent where would be helpful.

Email integration. Automatically parsing emails for application confirmations, interview invites, and updating the dashboard accordingly. Saves manual entry.

Mobile app or PWA. Access on the go, since job hunting isn't just desktop-based.

Achievement badges. Gamification to keep users motivated, like "Applied to 10 jobs" or "First Interview."

Job search aggregator. Built-in job board that pulls listings from various sites, with one-click application tracking.
